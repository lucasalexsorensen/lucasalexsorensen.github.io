I am a machine learning developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently, I'm at [Kontolink](https://kontolink.com) working towards creating the first fully-automated accounting system. I'm especially interested in computer vision, signal processing and high performance computing.

Occasionally, I might write a [blog post](https://lucasalexsorensen.super.site) about what I've been up to.
